                    <p>Let’s talk about how I fell in love with computer science.</p>

                    <p>Growing up, I spent my existential phase (read: adolescence) in Sacramento, CA. The rumors about the city are true—it’s hot, humid, boring, and dead.</p>

                    <p>To this day, I am still amazed that the response I get from someone after telling them I’m from Sacramento is the same line every single time: “Oh I went there for like a field trip once to city hall.”</p>

                    <p>And that’s it. That’s the city. It’s just the capital of California and not much else.</p>

                    <p>You see, there’s SoCal and the obsession with fame and the spotlight where everyone wants to be a fashion designer, a photographer, a celebrity, or some other occupation to make you feel like you belong in Los Angeles. Then there’s the Bay Area with Silicon Valley where everyone and their parents are engineers, encouraging Bay Area kids to pursue the STEM field and adding to the appeal of making six figures straight out of college.</p> 

                    <p>And then there’s Sac, where the most famous person is the governor of California and the biggest (and only well known) tech company is Intel, and to be honest no one in the city even knows what they produce besides the logo on a computer processor. This left little Jenna-Kaelyn no choice but to pursue the most obscure passions and occupations during her teenage years.</p>

                    <p>When I was 13, my dad let my paint the walls of my room any color I’d like. So of course I chose turquoise blue and tried to show off to all my friends while simultaneously blinding them and only allowing for them to stop squinting once the sun set and the light stopped bouncing off the bright blue walls. </p>

                    <p>Immediately I realized this was a mistake and to make up for it, decided to buy entirely new furniture that would have no color whatsoever. When my room was suddenly met with elongated “wow”s rather than “my eyes!” I noticed my newfound love and (hopefully) talent for interior designing. I would spend my afternoons browsing the internet and coming up with extravagant designs and models as if my room were the size of the Hogwarts cafeteria and not some 10 by 10 feet squared shoebox.</p>

                    <p>Then I took AP Language and Composition in the 11th grade. Ms. Moore let us write about whatever topics we’d like to for all four of our essays as long as they were in the style of abstract vs. concrete, persuasion, classification, and compare and contrast. So naturally I wrote about boys for all four of them. My “<a href="files/boys.pdf" target="_blank">Types of Boys</a>” paper is still my favorite piece of work to this day.</p>

                    <p>I was always obsessed with storytelling and sharing more details than necessary. I would take a 5 minute interaction and exaggerate it to the point where people wouldn’t believe it happened, but it did. My friends consistently groan at the absurd length of my stories but when instead I tell them the quick 2 minute synopsis of one, they feel as though they’ve been stripped of their rights to my David Sedaris type novels. I never once really thought that I could turn this into a profession such as becoming a writer as I thought no one else would want to read about my stories. But that all changed when I was asked to be president of the Awkward Club in high school so I could share all my awkward stories, like when I got expelled from Chinese school at the age of 5 for prank calling 911 on the school’s payphone. So from there, I decided to ditch the strange hobby for a 16 year old of furniture shopping and pursue writing. </p>

                    <p>But then a year later I took AP Physics. And I fell in love with the hard sciences. There was nothing more satisfying to me than finishing a physics exam and figuring out how to tackle complex problems. I saw more potential for an impact in physics rather than writing. </p>
