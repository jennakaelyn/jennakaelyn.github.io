            <h2 class="section-heading">If Melodramatic Was a Brand</h2>

            <p>It's currently the 17th of April in 2020 and, for those of you who live under a rock, America (along with the rest of the world) has been under lockdown for the past month due to the novel coronavirus. During this quarantine period, I've been spending time digging through my digital history and perusing through old documents from long ago to give myself something exciting to do, because why be productive when you can just dig yourself into a rabbit hole of nostalgia and pine over a period of your life that you can never return to?</p>

            <p>On a more serious note, I recently discovered an old cover letter I'd written for Spotify back when I was in college and applying for summer internships. This was during a time where I was a bit melodramatic about all the little things in life such as the simple experience of enjoying a piece of music. (If you've read my post about absurdism, you'd know why.) As much as I want to cringe at how insightful and inspiring I thought I was, I can't help but laugh and be grateful that I was this serious and excited about such a minor thing. At least it means I cared about something!</p>

            <p>I'm posting this now, years later, in the hopes that you'll find some entertainment in this cover letter as much as I do now. And for those who were wondering: this letter worked, but I never responded to the recruiter (oops!) and ended up moving forward with a different internship. Maybe someday I'll resubmit this in an application, but for now, let's just laugh :)</p>

            <i><p>To whom it may concern,</p>

			<p>My name is Jenna-Kaelyn Huang - I’m a third year computer science major at UC Berkeley looking for software engineering internships for Summer 2017. More specifically, I’m interested in exploring opportunities at Spotify.</p>
			 
			<p>Outside of academics, you can find me at any event involving live music; whether it's a world-renowned band or a local artist—I’ll be there. My passion for music first came during my freshman year of college when I found that it was the central adhesive behind my greatest friendships. A simple realization of similar music tastes sparks the fire between a new group of concert buddies turned best friends. Through music, I’ve been gifted everlasting friendships and a lifetime of memories even past the music festivals, concerts, and local debuts.</p>
			 
			<p>But listening is not nearly enough. Music exists in ways more than just sound waves hitting our eardrums. The true value in music is not only enjoying the sounds you like, but also discovering new music as well as sharing these new experiences with others. There’s a special type of comfort in listening to a song and remembering who recommended it to you, where you were when you first listened to it, and what life was like when this song had its larger presence in your music taste. There also exists an irreplaceable experience in listening to a song and knowing exactly which of your friends would enjoy this song too.</p>
			 
			<p>That’s where software engineering comes in. It’s easy to believe that code isn’t used for anything more than just developing products that make our lives a little easier, but a lot of times it can serve past simple convenience. Nothing will replace the sentimental experience of sharing new sounds with the people you love, but we can simulate it through tech. I believe the best projects are the ones that we find to be impactful. Though impact has a different meaning for each person, I know that developing a product that can give even one person the same feelings I experienced my freshman year is just enough impact for me.</p>
			 
			<p>At Spotify, I aim to make an impact with the technology behind musical experiences as the company branches out beyond just streaming. Music should be accessible to all of us, regardless of who we are, where we come from, and what we want to be. I can only hope to be a part of a team that wants to make that accessibility a reality.</p>
			 
			<p>Sincerely,
        <br>
			Jenna-Kaelyn Huang</p></i>
