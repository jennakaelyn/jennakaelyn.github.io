            <h2 class="section-heading">A Persistent Existence</h2>

            <p>My junior year of high school, I took a class on contemporary global issues. (Okay, fine. It was a graduation requirement, but life is a lot easier to live when I convince myself I'm entirely in control of my decisions.) In the class, we were assigned an open-ended project where we were to present to the class an issue we deemed important and relevant to the current times. It could be on any topic we wanted, so naturally I chose to educate my fellow classmates on the "dangers" of social media for the sake of relatability and an easy A.</p>

            <p>(Two months later I chose to present about Bitcoin, which was finally starting to take off at $454 a coin, much to my teacher's confusion. I ultimately decided against it since 1. I knew my peers would have trouble understand the concept of cryptocurrency and 2. I was too lazy to mine Bitcoin myself. Silly me.)</p>

            <p>In my presentation about social media, I highlighted a few shocking examples to show how it wasn't as safe or secure as we had assumed it to be. One included a friend who posted a bikini pic on her private Instagram, only to find out it was posted on a porn site ad a week later. Another was a friend who deleted photos off of her Facebook but didn't know that the direct links/URLs to the photos were still up and running, which meant her photos would last on the Internet forever.</p>

            <p>If we dig a little deeper into these examples, we learn that the Internet and our social networks aren't necessarily broken in that they still accidentally hold onto our "deleted" data, but rather we don't truly understand how its technology works. And what's more dangerous than a persistent, easily accessible database and a bunch of ignorant users?</p>

            <p>I've always been really serious (or paranoid, as my friends call it) about my privacy, from being uncomfortable with people entering my room to freaking out about people knowing slightly intimate details about me. I refused to take part in apps like Instagram, Snapchat, and Facebook for the sole purpose of not wanting to give people an all-accessible look into my life without knowing when and who was peeking into my world.</p>

            <p>But then I went to college and everyone, I mean everyone, was indulging in these apps. Initially, it didn't bother me too much, but eventually the fear of missing out on potentially some of my greatest life moments started to eat me alive, and I gave in. God, see how pathetic that sounds? That I thought I would have less of a memorable college experience because I wasn't on social media? Was that who I really wanted to become?</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Making Compromises With Myself</h2>

            <p>Still paranoid, I decided to make all of my social media accounts private, giving me some sort of agency as to who was allowed to peruse the bits of my personal life I'd chosen to publish online.</p>

            <p>Now let's take a look at the current stats:
              <ul>
                <li>Instagram - 24 images uploaded</li>
                <li>Facebook - 1000+ posts (that stopped coming around 2012)</li>
                <li>Snapchat - 17,010 points (means I rarely snap anyone)</li>
              </ul>
            </p>

            <p>Translated, this basically means that I don't post much. (Well, except for Facebook, but I'm going to attribute most of those posts to my 14 year old Facebook-happy self. Maybe I was just a dumb teenager who had a lot to say but no one to say it to. Still deleting those cringey, old posts to this day.) Hey, I guess that's pretty good for someone who never wanted to get attached or addicted to the social world.</p>

            <p>But more insightful than numbers is the instrinsic value I should have gotten from these applications. The whole point of social media is to allow you to connect to or experience a world which may or may not be accessible to you in real life. Was I easily able to keep in touch with the people in my life, near or far? Did I feel better about myself after looking at pictures of friends, family, or strangers? Was I able to learn and indulge in things that I would have never experienced in my day-to-day life? Did I feel more connected to people? But most importantly, did I even want to be?</p>

            <p>To be quite honest with you, no. No, I didn't. There was never a time where I resonated with any of the content I saw on any of these apps, as in they have never elicited any feelings out of me, whether that be happiness, jealousy, sadness, or even anger. From divisive politics on Facebook to extravagent lifestyles on Instagram to social gatherings I didn't participate in broadcasted on Snapchat, I never really once cared. Did I really want to know what my old high school acquaintance got her son for Christmas this year? No, but was I going to look anyways since it showed up on my feed? Yes. Did I gain anything out of that short perusal into her life? No.</p>

            <p>So why the hell was I wasting so much of my time with these apps?</p>

            <p>That was the exact revelation I had in October of 2017. Disappointed with myself, I deleted all my social media accounts and apps off my phone. It wasn't enough for me to no longer participate in these apps, I also wanted no one to be able to find me on the digital world ever again. I was excited for the influx of free time that would follow suit from this revelation, but it never came.</p>

            <p>Let's think about that for a second. I didn't gain any time from deleting the apps. Why? Because I never really prioritized them over any of my other hobbies anyways. I wasn't compromising time to do other things in order to surf the web, so exactly how much time was I losing because of social media anyways? None.</p>

            <p>Instead, the one thing I achieved from this excursion was learning how to no longer give a fuck.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Taking Things for What They Are</h2>

            <p>There came this new over-looming feeling of freedom in my romantic relationships. What does that mean? Well, I didn't really understand it at first either, until I recently read this <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/08/style/orbiting-dating.html">piece</a> by the NYT that explains the concept of orbiting and simultaneously takes the words right out of my mouth.</p>

            <p>Similar to ghosting, orbiting is removing yourself from someone's life without notice, but not entirely. To orbit someone, you may still follow and engage with their social media accounts, but to a limit, like still watching someone's story but never messaging them ever again. (God, this is getting pathetically millennial, and I apologize for it.) I didn't realize it at the time, but I was definitely overthinking small gestures and psyching myself out in relationships. "Why does he always view my story, but never likes my posts?" It even got to the point where I also would post something on my story solely for the purpose of sending someone a subliminal message, and it doesn't get much more embarrassing than that.</p>

            <p>I didn't know it at the time, but looking back now, I am very much disappointed with the person I'd become on social media. I was so proud of myself for never envying my friends who were out doing cooler things than me or wishing I had an amazing body after looking at Instagram models, but I was doing something much worse: falling victim to the inferiority complex that came with dating in the modern digital world.</p>

            <p>On social media, I was pertaining to its unspoken rules, allowing myself to be consumed with overthinking and worrying about such insignificant measures. I never wanted myself to become someone who cared about social media's metrics (likes, views, comments, etc), but I couldn't help it. It was slowly becoming a part of me, whether I liked it or not. And as I said earlier, nothing scares me more than feeling like I'm not in control of my own choices.</p>

            <p>With the removal of these apps, I have subsequently eliminated an additional dimension to my social life. The only thing that exists to me are the actions and events that I visibly experience with my own two eyes in the real world, and nothing else, leaving no more room for ambiguity or confusion when these events don't match up with the ones that occur in the digital world, making my life that much easier.</p>

            <p>Sure, you could say I could be an adult and learn to not let it affect me, especially when it comes to insignificant gestures such as a "like" on Instagram, but I'm also 22 years old. My world is made up of exaggeration and not knowing what I'm doing. Maybe there will be a time where I can be mature enough to have social media and not overthink what happens in that world, but for now, this'll do.</p>
