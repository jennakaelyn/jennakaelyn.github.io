            <h2 class="section-heading">Me Talk Pretty One Day</h2>
            <h5>Davis Sedaris</h5>
            <p>This is my all-time favorite book. It's a collection of short, personal stories chronicling Sedaris's life as he tries to figure out what exactly he's set out to do in this world. The reason behind why it's my favorite is that I'm a huge fan of first-person nonfiction storytelling, but it can be boring in the more popular forms such as biographies or memoirs. Instead, I prefer books where the author gets to recite their anecdotes in a more unfiltered, authentic, and genuine form with no underlying intentions or inhibitions. Sedaris exaggerates and dramatizes his memories just enough to be entertaining yet endearing when he opens up about his experiences with grief, adventure, addiction, self-actualization, and everything in between.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">The Last Lecture</h2>
            <h5>Randy Pausch</h5>
            <p>In a similar vein to Me Talk Pretty One Day, this is yet another collection of brief (yet shorter) personal stories by Pausch but in a different style. A computer science professor at CMU, Pausch was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer at 45 and was shortly told he had a few months left to live. In an effort to celebrate the rich and eventful life he lived, he put together one last lecture for his students where he shared a collection of his favorite memories and the valuable life lessons he learned from every single one of them, which is what this book is all about. The Last Lecture left me in a state of awe for the beautiful journey and escapade that is life, and Pausch does a tremendous job at keeping it lighthearted, moving, and exhilarating all at once even when we know what is to come. </p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck</h2>
            <h5>Mark Manson</h5>
            <p>I know I'm going to get a lot of flack for listing this one, but I have to be honest in admitting that this book actually did help me realize what is important in life. I didn't literally learn how not to give a fuck (which isn't even the intent of the book), but rather I discovered how to pick and choose my battles, finalize a set of core values to hold close to my heart, and define the metrics that I use to measure the fulfillment of said values. The point of this book is to share examples of things that we don't necessarily need to pay attention to and why we overreact to certain things that don't deserve much of our mental energy. After reading this book, I established a sort of aggressively conservative approach to defining the boundaries on what I will choose to spend my time and energy on.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">The Spirits of San Francisco</h2>
            <h5>Gary Kamiya</h5>
            <p>This is a much more recent book (published in Fall of 2020) that takes us around San Francisco on a journey to uncover the origins of some of SF's hidden gems in addition to a few of its famous landmarks. Every opening to a book is obviously written with intentions to draw the reader in but this book's preface was probably the most captivating I'd ever read. Kamiya started writing this book during the COVID-19 lockdown where the once-bustling SF streets defining uniquely distinct and eccentric neighborhoods quickly became not much more than an empty and unused road network. He shares with us how, as a long-time SF resident, unfamiliar the deserted (yet tranquil) abyss feels which reminds us that not only will we each personally be impacted by this pandemic, but our cities and their culture will too. As one reviewer put it, this book is for people who love San Francisco, its back allies, its dirty secrets. People who love to look up at the tiles on the roofs, at the gargoyles, and look down at the cobblestones, the Tran lines, and the sidewalks.</p>
