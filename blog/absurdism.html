            <p><i>Absurdism â€” the conflict between the human tendency to seek inherent value and meaning in life and the human inability to find any in a purposeless, meaningless or chaotic and irrational universe.</i></p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">The Concept</h2>

            <p>Simply put, absurdism is the belief that we live in a purposeless, chaotic world. It's the credence that there is no ultimate meaning to life, that things happen for no apparent reason and have no signifance behind them whatsoever. But whether the events that happen in our life are pre-determined for us or just a result of pure chance, that's up for debate.</p>

            <p>The most interesting part of all of this, to me, at least, is how people come to recognition of the concept. We've all heard one another question the meaning of life, but to what extent? I'll share my story of how I came to enlightment.</p>

            <p>My sophomore year of college, I met someone. As much as I wanted it to be romantic, it wasn't. Usually, when I meet someone, I can immediately tell by their mannerisms the type of person they are. It doesn't take much observing for me to figure out what type of persona they were trying to manifest onto me, but this one was different. After a couple months of getting to know each other, he opened up about his depression.</p>

            <p>Everyone has a different narrative as to how they came about depression. Some are struggling to cope with past traumas, some inherit their parent's trauama and never fully understand it, and some come to the realization of absurdism and have a hard time swallowing its truth.</p>

            <p>This one was an example of the latter. A direct quote from him reads "no one instance can be defined. And I just know in whatever amount of time, I will be dying and nothing in my life will have ever mattered at all. And you can't argue against that. In 300 years from now, I will not ever be remembered for anything, as will almost no one. That's why life is so meaningless."</p>

            <p>People come to terms with the idea of absurdism in 3 ways: suicide, religious, spiritual, or abstract belief in a transcendent realm, being, or idea, or acceptance of the absurd.
